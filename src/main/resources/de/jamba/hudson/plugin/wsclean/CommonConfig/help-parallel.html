    If set, clean-up happens on each node in parallel.
    <br>
    If not set, each node's clean-up is run to completion before the next is started.
    <p>
    Hint: Unless your nodes share the same underlying storage hardware and cannot cope with lots of deletion operations "all at once", it is suggested to have this flag set.
    If it is unset and you have lots of nodes, your builds will be delayed due to the need to contact each node in sequence.
