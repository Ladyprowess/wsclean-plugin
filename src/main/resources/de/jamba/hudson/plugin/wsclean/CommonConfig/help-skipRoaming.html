<div>
    Dictates what to do if a job's label expression is empty (a
    &quot;roaming&quot; project).
    <p>
        If we're inspecting what nodes <em>could</em> be used for a job <em>and</em>
        that job has no restriction where it can run then, if this is set we
        select no nodes, but if this is not set we select <em>all</em> nodes.
